There are some small projects I did using JavaScript#
These are:
-Pizza menu
-Tic Tac Toe
-Calculator

The first is Pizza menu,it has to input information in and also calculates the price of the order.

The second is a game tic tac toe. It is a circle and X game that the user has to decide where to place and
the winner is celebrated with music.

Finallly is a calculator,that has 4 basic functions-add,substract,multiply and divide.
